Try/catch blocks can’t catch errors that happen during React’s rendering process. Errors thrown in rendering methods or hooks bubble up through the component tree. 
Only Error Boundaries can catch these errors

// ✅ Using error boundary
function Parent() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <ChildComponent />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
